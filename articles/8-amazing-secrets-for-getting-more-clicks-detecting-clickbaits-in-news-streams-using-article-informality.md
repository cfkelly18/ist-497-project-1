- Novel informality features are the most important for clickbait classification
- Features
  - Content
    - Presence of adjectives, adverbs, quotes, exclamations, use of uppercase letters, questions
    - Unigrams and bigrams from title and body of a page
      - Also useful for text classification tasks like subjectivity anlysis and sentiment analysis
    - For positive and negative words, they used the dictionary created by Hu and Liu (Hu and Liu 2004)
  - Similarity
    - Similarity between title and top sentences of the body
      - Five features corresponding to the similarity between the title and the top one, two, three, four, and five sentences of the body
        - Used tf-idf encoding to compute the similarity and removed stopwords
  - Informality
    - Coleman-Liau score (CLScore)
    - RIX and LIX indices
    - Formality measure (fmeasure)
  - Forward-reference
    - Demonstratives, third person personal pronouns, definite article, and whether the title starts with an adverb
  - URL
    - Frequencies of dash, ampersand, uppercase letters, comma, period, equal-to sign, percentage sign, plus, tilde, underscore, and URL depth (number of forward slashes)
- Model
  - Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
- Feature extraction
  - Used Information Gain (Yang and Pederson 1996) to rank the features and discarded features with zero information gain
- Evaluation
  - Used precision, recall, and F-1 score
- Feature importance
  - Informality features are one of the most important features
  - Number of uppercase words, presence of questionmarks and exclamation marks in headlines (titles), and the length of the title (number of words) are the most important content features

Clickbait Tweet Classification

The aim of this project is to build an accurate binary classification model that can discriminate clickbait tweets from legitimate ones with high F-measure and AUC scores.

Each data instance consists of two parts: (1) the tweet itself, and (2) the actual news article (linked from the tweet).

**Rough Project Timeline**

1. Find features and models from below articles
2. Test features and models to find highest scores
3. Write project report

**Definitions**

AUC Score: Area Under Curve score. AUC refers to area under ROC curve. ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

Clickbait: Aims to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make readers of news websites curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content.

F1 Score: A measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score. p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relative samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive).

**How to Run**

1. Create a `data/` folder in the root of the repository
2. Paste the files downloaded from the link in the project description into that folder
3. (Optional) delete the `.zip` files
